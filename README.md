ASSEMBLER 


Developing the custom assembler for a hypothetical ISA to visualize memory access locations. The assembler will translate human-readable assembly code into machine code that can be executed by   the computerâ€™s processor while visualizing representation of memory access patterns over time. The assembler is made in such a way that it is able to handle the errors listed in the Project Instructions and Guidelines  hence ensures the smooth running of the Assembler.
